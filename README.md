Collection of passion projects re/ robotics

1. Includes projects, path planning algorithms, C++ work, and more...


FSM Project (./projects/fsm)
-> 8-state machine describing the motion of a robot that heads to a site and performs a 'scan'. Simulated using gazebo
  1. At starting position
  2. Determines path to scan site using an RRT-based path finding algorithm
  3. Move to task starting position
  4. Now proceed through obstacles to the "radioactive" scan site
